t&#363;Q, after the farsi, , for 'net' is an interactive tool for modelling 
graph states and running them in a quantum simulator.  To that end t&#363;Q 
empowers the user to simulate cluster-based quantum computing as an alternative 
to circuit-based quantum computing.  Furthermore the user can output its graph 
in openQASM format thereby enabling it to run a graph on any quantum computing 
facility to accept openQASM input.
